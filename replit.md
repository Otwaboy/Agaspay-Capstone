```

## User Roles
The system supports multiple user roles with different permissions:
1. **Admin** - Full system access
2. **Treasurer** - Financial management, billing, payments
3. **Secretary** - Resident registration, document management
4. **Meter Reader** - Water meter reading input
5. **Maintenance** - Task assignments and incident handling
6. **Resident** - View bills, make payments, report issues

## Environment Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables (.env)
- `PORT` - Backend server port (3000)
- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT token generation
- `JWT_LIFETIME` - Token expiration time
- `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` - PayMongo payment gateway API key
- `PHILSMS_API_KEY` - PhilSMS service API key
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)

## Replit Setup Notes

### Ports
- **Frontend:** Port 5000 (Vite dev server, bound to 0.0.0.0)
- **Backend:** Port 3000 (Express server, bound to localhost)
- **MongoDB:** Port 27017 (local instance for development, cloud for production)

### Key Configurations
1. **Vite Config:** 
   - Configured with `allowedHosts: true` to work with Replit's proxy system
   - **Vite Proxy:** All `/api` requests are forwarded to backend on `localhost:3000`
2. **CORS:** Backend allows Replit domains and localhost origins
3. **Database:** Uses MongoDB Atlas (cloud) with connection string in .env
4. **Backend Server:** Binds to `0.0.0.0:3000` (accessible from frontend via Vite proxy)
5. **Frontend Server:** Runs on `0.0.0.0:5000` (public-facing port)

### Workflows
- **Backend:** Starts MongoDB (if needed) and runs Express server with nodemon
- **Frontend:** Runs Vite dev server on port 5000 with HMR enabled

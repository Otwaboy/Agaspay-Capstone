3.1 Analysis 
 
 
The intention of this study is to develop AGASPAY: A Web-Based Barangay Waterworks Operation System that aims to improve the delivery of water services in Barangay Biking, Dauis, Bohol. The system will automate essential processes, including billing, payment, meter reading, incident reporting, and schedule management, to streamline operations and improve efficiency. Through this system, residents can conveniently access their water bills, make online payments, report incident issues, and receive announcements, while barangay officials can efficiently manage operations and reports. 
The analysis of the system makes use of the use case diagram and activity diagram. The use case diagram shows the structure composing the relationship between the system and actors. The activity diagram is used to show the conditional logic for the sequence of system activities needed to accomplish. 
There are seven (7) use cases, and six (6) actors identified in the use case diagram. The identified use cases are the Manage User Account, Manage Water 
Connection/Disconnection, Manage Meter Readings and Billing, Manage 
Payments, Manage Incident Reports, Manage Schedule and Announcements and 
Generate Reports. The identified actors are the Residents, Barangay Secretary, Barangay Treasurer, Meter Reader, Maintenance, and Head of Waterworks (Admin). 
In the Manage User Account use case, the Head of Waterworks (Admin) is responsible for creating the accounts of other barangay personnel, including the 
Barangay Secretary, Treasurer, Meter Reader, and Maintenance. The Barangay Secretary creates the resident’s account, encodes their record, and registers the meter into the system once all requirements for installation are met. These users cannot register on their own; their accounts must be created by the Head of Waterworks (Admin) and Barangay Secretary. To create an account, in the Admin and Secretary Dashboard, they will select the Add New User option, inputs the required information, assigns the appropriate role, and sets a default password. Once the accounts for the Barangay Secretary, Treasurer, Meter Reader, Maintenance, and Residents accounts are set up, they are permitted to update personal details, change passwords.  The Residents who are already disconnected from the barangay water service may request account archive. Upon submission, the request is forwarded to the Head of Waterworks (Admin) for approval. Once approved, the Head of Waterworks (Admin) proceeds to archive the resident’s account from the system. Only the Head of Waterworks (Admin) is authorized to archive the accounts of the Barangay Secretary, Treasurer, Meter Reader, and Maintenance. This ensures that access is tailored to specific user roles, maintaining system integrity and administrative control. 
In the Manage Water Connection/Disconnections use case, a resident seeking a new connection must submit the required documents at the barangay hall, provide their own water meter, and pay a connection fee to the Barangay Treasurer, who processes the payment and records the transaction. The system then assigns the resident a 'Pending Installation' status, indicating that their application has been approved and the installation is pending. The Barangay Secretary click the “Schedule task” button to schedule the installation, an installation task is automatically scheduled in the next available slot and assigned to the Maintenance team. This task appears on the Maintenance dashboard with a status of “Pending”. Once the installation is completed, Maintenance updates the status to “Active,” which the resident can view in their account. For disconnections due to non-payment, the system automatically generates a list of residents who have not paid for three consecutive months. A disconnection notice is generated and sent directly to the resident as a SMS and in-app notification. Once the notice is issued, the resident’s status is updated to “For Disconnection.” Residents are given one week to settle their dues. If no payment is made within the grace period, The Barangay Secretary click the “Schedule task” button to schedule the disconnection, the system automatically schedules the disconnection task in the next available slot and assigns it to the Maintenance team. This task appears on the Maintenance dashboard with a status of “Scheduled for Disconnection”. Once the task is executed, Maintenance updates the connection status from “Active” to “Disconnected.” Residents with a disconnected status can still log in to their accounts to view bills and connection status, but online payment is disabled until balances are settled on-site at the barangay hall. For voluntary disconnections, residents who are permanently leaving Barangay Biking may select the disconnection option through the system. Once selected, The Barangay Secretary click the “Schedule task” button to schedule the disconnection, the system automatically updates the account status to “For Voluntary Disconnection” and schedules the disconnection task in the next available slot, assigning it to the Maintenance team. After execution, the resident’s account is updated to “Disconnected,” with the option available only for archiving. For reconnections, a disconnected resident must settle outstanding balances and pay a reconnection fee at the barangay hall. Once the Treasurer records the payment, The Barangay Secretary click the “Schedule task” button to schedule the reconnection, the system automatically schedules the reconnection task in the next available slot and assigns it to the Maintenance team. If required, the resident must also provide necessary materials for reconnection. After the meter is reinstalled, Maintenance updates the connection status to “Active,” which is visible to the resident, Treasurer, and Secretary in the system. 
 In the Manage Meter Readings and Billing use case, meter readers are responsible for recording household water consumption. Each resident’s meter reading has a monthly status to track its progress in the system. Readings are conducted on a fixed schedule specifically during the third to fourth week of each month. The coverage areas are divided into Biking 1 (Puroks 4, 5, and 6), Biking 2 (Puroks 1, 2, and 3), and Biking 3 (Purok 7). Each zone has an assigned meter reader. They access a digital master list of residents per purok through a mobilefriendly system interface. While reading of meters is on-going, residents cannot yet view them. The status of that month’s meter reading record is marked as "In Progress." Once a Meter Reader completes all readings for their assigned zone, their status changes to “Submitted,” and they are forwarded to the Barangay Treasurer for validation. After reviewing the readings, the Treasurer sets the final status to “Approved.” Only at this point do the readings become visible to residents and available for billing. Residents, The Head of Waterworks (Admin) and Barangay Secretary can then view final readings and corresponding water consumption records. Meter Readers are allowed to edit submitted readings only while the status is still marked as 'Submitted' and has not yet been approved by the Barangay Treasurer. Once the readings are approved, they can no longer be edited. The Barangay Treasurer simply clicks the “Generate Bill” button to compute the water bills after approving the submitted readings. The billing computation is computed at the same time across Biking 1, 2, and 3. It follows a standard formula: (Present Reading - Previous Reading) x rate per cubic meter. Once the bill is generated, a system notification is sent to the Resident informing them that their bill is ready. The bill then becomes accessible to the Resident, Treasurer, and Head of Waterworks (Admin). If a resident has not paid for over three months, the system triggers a delinquency notification to inform the resident of their overdue 
balance. 	 
In the Manage Payments use case, The residents may pay either through on-site or online. For on-site payments, the Barangay Treasurer processes and records the payment, and the resident can claim the official receipt at the barangay hall. For online payments, residents can use e-payment methods. After payment, the system automatically generates a temporary receipt for the resident’s reference. The Treasurer can view a list of online payments marked as “Pending Confirmation” in the system. After confirming each transaction, the Treasurer updates the status to “Confirmed – Paid Online”. Once the official receipt is manually issued, the status is updated to “Official Receipt Issued.” This lets the system display only transactions that still need official receipts. The payment status is updated in real-time as follows: “Pending” when no payment has been made, “Partially Paid” when only part of the bill is paid, “Fully Paid” once the total amount is settled, and confirmed after the Treasurer confirms the payment. The Residents can view their payment history through their account.  
In the Manage Incident Reports use case, Residents and Meter Readers can report issues such as pipe leaks, outages, or broken meters. Reports require essential details such as issue type, exact location, and remarks. The report is automatically assigned the status “Pending”, and becomes visible to the Barangay Secretary, Head of Waterworks (Admin), and assigned Maintenance Personnel for immediate awareness. The Barangay Secretary can monitor the report’s status and coordinates with the Maintenance team to resolve the problem. Submitted incident reports are automatically visible to Maintenance personnel through the system, allowing them to be immediately informed of any issues. The Barangay Secretary clicks the “Schedule Task” button to schedule the issue reported. The system automatically assesses the urgency of each report, checks for conflicts with other scheduled tasks, and assigns it to the next available slot. If no slot is available and the issue is marked urgent, the Secretary can manually reschedule tasks to prioritize the urgent report before confirming the schedule. Once scheduled, the Maintenance updates the task status to either ‘In Progress’ or ‘Completed,’ helping the Head of Waterworks and Barangay Secretary monitor workload and response times. Meanwhile, the Head of Waterworks (Admin) uses the system dashboard to track the frequency and types of incidents and evaluate response efficiency. The one who reported can view updates regarding the status of his/her report. 
In the Manage Schedule and Announcements use case, the Barangay Secretary creates and updates official water supply schedules, including start and end times for each service area. They also prepare announcements regarding billing reminders, service interruptions, or disconnections. Once announcements or schedules are drafted, they are submitted for approval to the Head of Waterworks (Admin). Once approved by the Head of Waterworks, the information is automatically published through the system. Notifications are then sent via both in-app and SMS to ensure all residents are promptly informed. Residents can view the announcements. 
In the Generate Reports use case, specific barangay personnel are assigned to generate designated types of reports. The Barangay Treasurer is responsible for financial-related reports, including billing collection, delinquency records. The Barangay Secretary generates connection-related reports such as records of water connection and resolve and pending issues. Meanwhile, the Head of Waterworks (Admin) generates operational report, such as issue reported. These reports include the total number of resolved issues and the most frequently reported service problems. Such data allows the Head of Waterworks to assess service efficiency, identify issues, and make informed decisions to improve the overall performance and reliability of the barangay waterworks operation.
